ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND\n\nLewis Carroll\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\non the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had\npeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\nthought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\nfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to\nitself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.
